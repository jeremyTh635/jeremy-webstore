# About my webstore app

This site was developed as the final project in the front-end/React component of Hyperion.Dev’s web development bootcamp. The following are the instructions for using the app and information regarding how to download and install it.

## Using the app

The app was conceived as an online store which sells high quality framed photographs. The landing page displays the name of the store, a carousel of what the store sells and some information about the store. The user will be asked to register. They can do so by selecting REGISTER from the top menu which will take them to the registration page. After entering their first name, last name, a username, their email and a password, clicking submit will return them to the landing page automatically without having to click HOME from the top menu.

Once there, the user can log in with their username and password. Clicking the login button will bring up a pop-up and clicking ‘Submit’ will display the user’s username at the top right of the screen and will take them directly to the products page without having to select PRODUCTS from the top menu.

The products page displays what the store has to sell along with names of the photographers, titles, years and prices in £ Sterling. Clicking the ‘Add to Cart’ button will add the picture to the cart as well as take the user directly to the cart page.

The ‘Your Cart’ page displays cards containing the picture, its title, the quantity of that picture the user would like to order, and the price. The card has a ‘Remove from Cart’ button at the bottom should the user change their mind. If the user wants to add additional pictures or copies of the same photo, they will need to return to the products page using the top menu and add them from there. Multiple copies of the same picture will increase the quantity on the card. The page displays the total price of the items in the cart to the right of the cards. As items are added, the total price updates.

Beneath the total price, there is an info icon. Clicking on this will bring up a pop-up which explains the shipping options with their prices. There are also two radio buttons which allow the user to select which option they’d like. Clicking either one adds the shipping cost to the card as well as to the total price.

## Viewing the code and installing the app

The code which I wrote to develop the app can be found in my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/jeremyTh635/jeremy-webstore/tree/main). It can be downloaded by selecting the ‘Download zip’ option from dropdown under the green ‘Code’ button at the top of the page.
